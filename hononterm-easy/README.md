# Instances reduced from easy(\*) higher-order nontermination problem by Rethfl[Katsura+ APLAS20](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-64437-6_5)


(\*) "easy" means that when reducing nontermination problems of ml programs to \\nu HFLz validity checking, exitential quantifiers \\exists n. P(n) are encoded by P(-3) \\/ P(0) \\/ P(1) \\/ P(3) \\/ P(10).

These instances are considered to be valid. Notify me if you think some of them are invalid.
